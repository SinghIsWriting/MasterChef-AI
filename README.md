## AI Algorithms
MasterChef-AI uses AI algorithms to generate personalized recipes based on user preferences. The algorithms take into account the user's dietary restrictions, preferred ingredients, and cooking skills to generate recipes that are tailored to the user's needs.
The AI algorithms are implemented in the masterChefAI.py file. The file contains the following functions:

- masterChef(): Generates a recipe based on food name provided by the user.
- masterChefPro(): Generates a recipe based on list of ingredients provided by the user.

These functions are called by the Django views to generate and display the recipes to the user.

## Configuration

* To use the OpenAI API, you need to set the `API_KEY` environment variable in a `.env` file outside the project folder. The `.env` file should contain the following line:
`API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"`
* Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Session-Based Recipe Storage

MasterChef-AI uses Django sessions to store the recipes generated by the user. When a user searches for a recipe, the app generates a personalized recipe using the OpenAI API and stores it in the user's session. When the user returns to the webpage, the app retrieves the stored recipe from the session and displays it to the user.
